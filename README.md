*CMakeLists.txt for building CodeSynthesis XSD/e*


You can only download binaries/makefiles at XSD/e download page (http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsde/download.xhtml), so it becomes a mess if your project uses CMake: use different binaries for different platforms is pain. It's much more convenient to compile everything from sources. 

This is a mostly draft, but working CMakeLists.txt for CodeSynthresis XSD/e 3.2.0, rewritten from one of makefiles. Right now cxx-parser and cxx-hybrid are tested. 

Any help in development is highly appreciated!
